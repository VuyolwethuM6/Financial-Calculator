
1. **Importing Tkinter:**
   ```python
   import tkinter as tk
   from tkinter import ttk
   ```
   - Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package for Python.
   - `ttk` provides themed Tkinter widgets, which have a more modern and native look.

2. **Creating the Main Window:**
   ```python
   root = tk.Tk()
   root.title("Financial Calculator")
   ```
   - `Tk()` creates the main window object.
   - `title()` sets the title of the window.

3. **Creating Tabs with `ttk.Notebook`:**
   ```python
   notebook = ttk.Notebook(root)
   ```
   - `ttk.Notebook` is used to create a tabbed interface.

4. **Creating Frames for Each Tab:**
   ```python
   investment_frame = ttk.Frame(notebook)
   bond_frame = ttk.Frame(notebook)
   ```
   - Frames are containers for organizing and grouping widgets.

5. **Adding Tabs to the Notebook:**
   ```python
   notebook.add(investment_frame, text="Investment")
   notebook.add(bond_frame, text="Bond")
   notebook.pack(expand=True, fill="both")
   ```
   - `add()` method adds frames to the notebook with specified tab names.
   - `pack()` method organizes the notebook within the main window.

6. **Creating Labels, Entries, Combobox, and Buttons:**
   - Labels (`ttk.Label`): Display static text.
   - Entries (`ttk.Entry`): Allow user input.
   - Combobox (`ttk.Combobox`): A drop-down list for selecting options.
   - Button (`ttk.Button`): Trigger actions.
   ```python
   label_principal = ttk.Label(investment_frame, text="Principal:")
   entry_principal = ttk.Entry(investment_frame)
   combo_interest_type = ttk.Combobox(investment_frame, values=["Simple", "Compound"])
   calculate_button = ttk.Button(investment_frame, text="Calculate", command=on_calculate)
   ```

7. **Grid Layout for Widgets:**
   - `grid()` method organizes widgets in rows and columns.
   ```python
   label_principal.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=5, pady=5, sticky="e")
   entry_principal.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)
   ```

8. **Handling Events with Functions:**
   ```python
   def on_calculate():
       option = notebook.index(notebook.select())
       if option == 0:
           # Handle Investment calculation
       elif option == 1:
           # Handle Bond calculation
   ```
   - Functions are defined to handle events, such as button clicks.

9. **Starting the Tkinter Event Loop:**
   ```python
   root.mainloop()
   ```
   - `mainloop()` starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the GUI to respond to user actions.

These key points cover the basic structure of a Tkinter GUI application. The code provided demonstrates a simple finance calculator with tabs for investment and bond calculations. Understanding these fundamentals will help you create and customize your own Tkinter applications.
